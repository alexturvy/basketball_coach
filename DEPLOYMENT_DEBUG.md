# üîç Let's Debug Your Current Deployment

You're right - we need both frontend and backend. The issue is likely a simple configuration problem. Let's diagnose:

## Quick Check

1. **Go to your Vercel dashboard**
2. **Find your basketball coach project**
3. **Click on it to see the deployment details**

## Look for these specific things:

### Build Settings
- **Framework Preset**: Should say "Create React App"
- **Build Command**: Should be something like `cd frontend && npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: Should be `frontend/build`
- **Install Command**: Should be `cd frontend && npm install`

### If any of these are wrong:
1. Click "Settings" in your project
2. Click "General" 
3. Scroll to "Build & Development Settings"
4. Edit these fields to match above

### Root Directory Issue
**Most likely problem**: Vercel might be trying to build from the wrong directory.

1. In your project settings
2. Look for "Root Directory" 
3. **It should be set to `frontend`** (not blank, not root)
4. If it's wrong, change it to `frontend`

### Environment Variables Check
1. Go to "Settings" ‚Üí "Environment Variables"
2. Make sure you have:
   - Name: `REACT_APP_API_URL`
   - Value: `https://basketball-coach-api.onrender.com`

## Alternative: Start Fresh (If Above Doesn't Work)

Sometimes it's easier to just delete and recreate:

1. **Delete current Vercel project**:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Delete Project

2. **Create new one properly**:
   - Import repository again
   - **Set Root Directory to `frontend`** during initial setup
   - Framework will auto-detect as Create React App
   - Add environment variable
   - Deploy

This ensures clean configuration from the start.

## The Goal

Your app should work at the Vercel URL first, then we can worry about custom domains. Both frontend and backend will be running - frontend on Vercel, backend on Render.

**What do you see in your current Vercel project settings?**
