# 🔍 Debug the Video Analysis Issue

The frontend is loading but not processing videos. Let's debug step by step:

## Step 1: Redeploy Backend with CORS Fix

1. **Go to Render.com dashboard**
2. **Find your basketball-coach-api service**
3. **Click on it**
4. **Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"**
5. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment to complete

## Step 2: Test with Browser Console

1. **Open your basketball coach app** in Vercel
2. **Press F12** to open browser console
3. **Start dribbling** in front of camera
4. **Watch the console messages** - you should see:
   - "Basketball Coach: Setting up camera..."
   - "API URL: https://basketball-coach-api.onrender.com"
   - "Sending video for analysis... [size] bytes"
   - "Response status: [number]"

## Step 3: Check for Common Issues

### Issue 1: CORS Error
**What to look for**: Error mentioning "CORS" or "cross-origin"
**Solution**: Backend redeploy should fix this

### Issue 2: Large Video Files
**What to look for**: Video size > 10MB in console
**Solution**: Videos might be too large for Render's free tier

### Issue 3: API Connection Failed
**What to look for**: "Network error" or "Failed to fetch"
**Solution**: Check if backend is still running

### Issue 4: Render Sleeping
**What to look for**: Very slow response (>30 seconds)
**Solution**: Render free tier "sleeps" - first request wakes it up

## Step 4: Manual API Test

Test the backend directly:
1. Go to: https://basketball-coach-api.onrender.com
2. Should show: `{"Hello":"Basketball Coach AI"}`
3. If not working, backend needs debugging

## What To Report Back

After trying the above, tell me:
1. **What console messages** you see when dribbling
2. **Any error messages** (red text in console)
3. **How long** it stays in "recording" mode
4. **Backend test result** from Step 4

This will pinpoint exactly what's failing! 🎯
