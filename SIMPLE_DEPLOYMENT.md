# ðŸš€ Simple Deployment Fix

The current setup is having routing issues. Let's use a simpler approach:

## Option 1: Deploy Frontend Folder Directly (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create New Vercel Project
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click "Add New..." â†’ "Project"
3. Click "Import" next to your basketball_coach repository
4. **IMPORTANT**: In "Configure Project" section:
   - Click "Edit" next to "Root Directory"
   - Select `frontend` folder
   - Leave everything else as default
5. Add Environment Variable:
   - Name: `REACT_APP_API_URL`
   - Value: `https://basketball-coach-api.onrender.com`
6. Click "Deploy"

This deploys ONLY the frontend folder, avoiding routing conflicts.

## Option 2: Quick Test with Netlify (Alternative)

If Vercel keeps having issues:

1. Go to https://netlify.com
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "Add new site" â†’ "Import an existing project"
4. Choose GitHub â†’ Select basketball_coach repo
5. **Build settings**:
   - Base directory: `frontend`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `frontend/build`
6. **Environment variables**:
   - `REACT_APP_API_URL` = `https://basketball-coach-api.onrender.com`
7. Click "Deploy"

## Why This Works Better

The issue is that your repo has both frontend and backend folders, and Vercel is getting confused about which to deploy. By selecting just the frontend folder as the root, it deploys cleanly as a React app.

## After Deployment

Once you get a working URL from either platform, you can:
1. Use that URL directly, OR
2. Set up a custom domain later once it's working

The key is getting it working first, then worry about the custom domain!
